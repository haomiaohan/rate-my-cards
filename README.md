At present, there are hundreds - if not thousands - of credit cards available for U.S. customers. Most of them offer a reward program whereby cardholders can get either cash back or reward points for every dollar they spend on the card; however, the reward program usually differs from one card to another, and customers are often confused as for which card offers them the most rewards for their spend.

RateMyCards is a website that recommends the best credit cards for every customer based on his/her monthly spending habits. The algorithm is simple yet effective: by calculating how much cash back (or reward points) one customer can earn by using different cards, RateMyCards is able to generate a personalized list of credit cards that offers the most rewards for the customer. In this way, customers are able to make better-informed decisions with regard to credit cards and become less susceptible to misleading/inaccurate advertisement of inferior cards.
